Welcome to Project Kiwi
============================================

Project Kiwi has been designed from the ground up to allow users to bring their own science to their GIS data. 
At it's core it can be used as a tool to label data with assistance from your models. We hope this API will allow you to apply your own models or get started with the object detection models that are available at the time of writing!
